Win to Mac
==========

I had been unsuccessfully looking for a 1-click script which would turn my newly purchased Windows 11 laptop into something similar to macOS 15.

That's why I eventually started working on my own collection of key bindings, apps and tools.

The goal of this project is to replicate macOS user experience in Windows 11 because all existing solutions are not perfect and have a lot of little issues here and there that make them painful to use.

For keyboard bindings I currently use:
- KeyTweak.
- Autohotkey 2.
